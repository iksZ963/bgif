:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The purpose of this project is to create a simple and accessible GIF hosting website targeting online users in Bangladesh. The site aims to provide a platform where users can browse, upload, and share GIFs. Initially, the site will be in English, but the design will allow for easy addition of Bengali language support in the future. The focus will be on simplicity, ease of use, and ensuring a lightweight experience suitable for varying internet speeds in the region.

== Requirements

The following requirements have been identified for the initial version of the site, following the MoSCoW prioritization method:

*Must-Have:*
1. **Streamlined User Interface**: A clean, intuitive interface that is easy to navigate, with large, visually appealing GIF thumbnails and simple categorization (e.g., trending, popular, new).
2. **Enhanced Search and Discovery**: Robust search engine with filters for categories, tags, popularity, and upload date, along with predictive search and a "Related GIFs" feature.
3. **Optimized Performance**: Fast load times and smooth GIF playback achieved through optimized compression techniques, the use of a CDN, and lazy loading.
4. **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layouts for different screen sizes, touch-friendly interactions, and performance optimizations for mobile users.
5. **User Interaction (Excluding Commenting)**: Features to like, share, and save GIFs to "Favorites," encouraging user engagement and personalization.
6. **Integration with Messaging and Social Media**: Easy sharing options for popular messaging apps and social media platforms, along with embeddable GIF links.

*Should-Have:*
1. **Content Moderation and Quality Control**: Automated tools for filtering inappropriate content, user reporting options, and a moderation team to review flagged items. Establishing content quality guidelines.
2. **Localized Experience with Multilingual Support**: Initial support in English with the framework ready to add Bengali in the future. Using language files for easy translation and providing culturally relevant content.

*Could-Have:*
- Advanced content creation tools like converting videos to GIFs directly on the platform.

*Won't-Have:*
- Advanced community features such as commenting, forums, or chat for the initial version.
- Complex personalization features or recommendation engines in the initial release.

== Method

The technical architecture and design of the GIF hosting site will leverage the MERN stack, ensuring a full JavaScript environment and facilitating scalability and performance. Below are the core components and their implementation strategies:

=== Architecture Overview

1. **Frontend**: Developed using React, hosted on Vercel. React will provide a dynamic, responsive, and mobile-first user interface.
2. **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express.js, hosted on DigitalOcean. This will handle the server-side logic, API endpoints, and integrations.
3. **Database**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, will be used to store user data, GIF metadata, and other necessary information.
4. **Storage**: GIFs will be stored in DigitalOcean Spaces (or AWS S3), ensuring scalability and high availability.
5. **CDN**: Cloudflare will be used to deliver GIFs efficiently to users by caching content closer to the user’s location.
6. **Domain and SSL**: Domain will be configured on Vercel with SSL/TLS certificates provided by Let’s Encrypt for secure communication.

=== Component Details

1. **User Interface (React)**:
   - **Pages**: Home, Search Results, GIF Detail, Upload, Profile, Favorites.
   - **Components**: Header, Footer, GIF Card, Search Bar, Like Button, Share Button, Upload Form.
   - **State Management**: Use React’s Context API or Redux for managing global state.
   - **Routing**: React Router will be used for navigation between pages.

2. **Backend API (Node.js/Express)**:
   - **Endpoints**: 
     - `POST /api/upload`: Handles GIF uploads.
     - `GET /api/gifs`: Retrieves GIFs based on filters (search, trending, categories).
     - `POST /api/gifs/:id/like`: Handles liking of GIFs.
     - `POST /api/gifs/:id/share`: Generates shareable links.
     - `GET /api/users/:id/favorites`: Retrieves user’s favorite GIFs.
   - **Middleware**: For authentication, logging, and error handling.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - **Schemas**:
     - `User`: `{ username, email, password, favorites: [GIF] }`
     - `GIF`: `{ title, url, tags: [String], uploadedBy, createdAt, likes }`
   - **Indexes**: Indexing on fields like `tags` and `createdAt` for fast searching and sorting.

4. **Storage and CDN (DigitalOcean Spaces + Cloudflare)**:
   - GIFs will be uploaded to DigitalOcean Spaces, and Cloudflare will be configured to cache and deliver these files quickly.

=== Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used for user authentication.
2. **Data Validation**: Input validation on both frontend and backend to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
3. **HTTPS**: Ensure all communication is encrypted using HTTPS. 

== Implementation

The implementation steps will follow an iterative approach to ensure continuous integration and delivery.

=== Step 1: Setup and Initial Configuration

1. **Initialize the Project**: Set up a Git repository. Initialize the React frontend and Node.js backend projects.
2. **Environment Configuration**: Set up environment variables for database connections, API keys, and storage.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary npm packages for React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, etc.
4. **Vercel and DigitalOcean Setup**: Configure initial deployment settings for Vercel (frontend) and DigitalOcean (backend).

=== Step 2: Develop Core Features

1. **Frontend**:
   - Build basic UI components and layouts using React.
   - Implement routing with React Router.
   - Connect to backend APIs for fetching and displaying GIFs.

2. **Backend**:
   - Set up basic API endpoints with Express.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT.
   - Integrate with MongoDB for storing user data and GIF metadata.
   - Connect to DigitalOcean Spaces for GIF uploads.

3. **Integration**:
   - Test integration between frontend and backend.
   - Implement like, share, and save to favorites functionalities.
   - Ensure smooth interaction between the frontend and backend APIs.

=== Step 3: Optimization and Testing

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement lazy loading for GIFs.
   - Optimize React components for performance.
   - Use compression techniques for faster load times.

2. **Testing**:
   - Conduct unit and integration testing for both frontend and backend components.
   - Perform load testing to assess how the application handles traffic.
   - User acceptance testing to gather feedback on usability.

=== Step 4: Finalizing and Preparing for Deployment

1. **Review and Refactor Code**: Ensure code quality and best practices.
2. **Setup Production Environment**: Configure production settings for Vercel, DigitalOcean, and Cloudflare.
3. **Migrate to Production Database**: Move from development to a production-grade MongoDB instance.
